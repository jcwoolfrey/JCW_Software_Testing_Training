# JCW_Software_Testing_Training
A playground for learning software testing. It is a simple marketplace application that allows a user to learn software testing without the worry of taking down a production environment.

The purpose of this application is to teach basic unit testing and eventually more complex forms of software testing. The application under test is a simple toy store website where items can be browsed and added to a cart. The application is from a training Microsoft created to teach developers how to use ASP.net. The application in the training is not fully implemented because there are plans to build out a curriculum to do Test Driven Development(TDD) where a user could write tests and then follow the training. Here is a link to the training used to build this application. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-aspnet-45-web-forms/

To get started, clone this repo using steps that can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). I also recommend downloading Visual Studios if you don't all ready have it installed. You should be able to open the Testing.sln file in Visual Studios, run the application and a browser should open to https://localhost:44322/Default.aspx which is the main page of Wingtip Toys. Once you have the application up and running go to the Instructions.txt file to learn about software testing.

Additional testing resources can be found in the Extras folder.
* Test Heuristics Cheat Sheet - Provides examples of things that could be tested. Great for building a full test plan or sparking an idea when stuck.
* Security Lens Items - Specific testing for security. Not an exhaustive list and checking with your security team is still needed. But this can give you a good starting point for security testing.
* Software Quality Characteristics - A list of characteristics that software has and can lead to good software. It is another lens to look through when testing software. The second page has a list of characteristics specifically for the quality for the team working on it rather than the consumer.
